# Data-Visualization
Data viz for all the personal projects I have done until now. Here a little summary about them and the insights found:

## Unicorn Companies:
 1.Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?
 2.How long does it usually take for a company to become a unicorn? Has it always been this way?
 3.Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any cities that appear to be industry hubs?
 4.Which investors have funded the most unicorns?
