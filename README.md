# Data-Visualization 🌐
Data viz for all the personal projects I have done until now. 

I'll try to upload a new project every week in order to have an up to date portfolio and you can be able to see my progress as Data Analyst 😊.

Also, I hope this can be used for future Data Analysts as an inspiration 💪.

So, here a little summary about them and the analysis done:

## Unicorn Companies 🦄:
 Private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022 
 
 1.Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?  
 2.How long does it usually take for a company to become a unicorn? Has it always been this way?  
 3.Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any cities that appear to be industry hubs?  
 4.Which investors have funded the most unicorns?
